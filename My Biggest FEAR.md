# **My Greatest Fear**
 
 
### My greatest fear in life is not preparing my little sister for the future. I desire for her to experience a better childhood and overall life than me by:
 
- ### Teaching her valuable lessons I have learned
- ### Telling her about situations to never place yourself in
- ### Providing her with useful information and knowledge I have gained about school and life
 
 
## Reasons Why I Desire to Achieve This
I have made multitudes of mistakes, which I have significantly learned from. However, I do not want my sister to experience the mistakes I have made or the situations I have been in. Throughout my life I have been quite naive, yet sharp and nimble as well. Because of this, anger, frustration, stress and nervousness somewhat controlled me.
 
My sister is in grade 6, and she has achieved much more than I have at her age. She is extremely hardworking and determined to achieve her goals, and also enjoys being active. Similarly to me, I am seeing her heading into the same direction I took, so I am trying to teach her skills that I have learned.
 
## What I have to Keep in Mind
* ### The rapidly changing society
  * #### Likes and dislikes
  * #### Newly formed judgements
* ### Her changing goals as a child
  * | Age   | Career      |

    |    9  | Activist    |
    |   10  | Politician  |
    |   11  | Computer Scientist|
* ### How she prefers to do tasks and activities
  * #### How she learns
  * #### Her current traits and skills
  * #### What she can develop and improve upon
  * #### Her preferred schedule
 
## My Current Goal
My current goal is to teach her time management and life balance because she is struggling with time balance between school, her personal life and her favourite activies, like I do. Overall, I have somewhat gained a better understanding within these last few months of how I learn and how much work is sufficient, but I still struggle. Although she is in elementary school, she enjoys exceeding expectations and over achieving. Ultimately, I immensely love my sister and always want the best for her. Thus, I keep this quote in mind:
