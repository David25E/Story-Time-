# Story-Time - My Greatest Fear

#### This paper is about my greatest fear in life as a teenager.  
Welcome, I am David Egete, a 15 year old boy in grade 10 who goes to Our Lady of Lourdes High School.  
This is my first ever github project, which is a markdown assignment.

## What I am Writing About
#### My greatest fear in life is not preparing my little sister for the future. I understand I am still a naive teenager, but I am slowly learning some extremely helpful lessons.

__Reasons Why__
* Provide a better understanding of *school and life*
* Teach her valuable lessons
* Teach her ***difficult social skills***, which we both struggle with
* Boost her confidence

## My Role As a Brother
> As a brother I am required to form the best future for my sister, and allow her to fulfill her potential. She already showcases the necessary character traits, however, I have to remove the poor habits from her life as soon as possible.
> Especially since she is still young, it is most important to teach her now.
